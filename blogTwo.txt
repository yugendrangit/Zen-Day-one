OBJECT AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTAION IN JAVASCRIPT

Object in javascript : Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
Object is collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: Person, car, pen etc.

Internal Representation : 

Object Properties :
The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.

Object Methods :
An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

Take a car as an example : All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. All cars have the same methods, 
                           but the methods are performed at different times.

Car properties like :

Make: Toyato 
Model: Innova
Color: White
Fuel: Diesel
Weight: 850kg
Mileage: 8Kmpl
Rating: 4.8

variable named car : var car = "Toyato"

Object Properties : name : values pairs

var car = {Make: "Toyato", Model: “Innova”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”,Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.8};

You can access object properties in two ways : objectName.propertyName or objectName["propertyName"]
